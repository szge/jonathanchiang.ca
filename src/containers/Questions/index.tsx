            I created this because I think that the simple act of listening to
            another person is one of the greatest gifts you can give someone
            (and yourself!). Sit down with a stranger, friend, family member, or
            lover and get in the mood for some meaningful conversation. Pick the
            topics you&apos;d like to talk about and ask each other a question!
